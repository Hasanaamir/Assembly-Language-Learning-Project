# Assembly Language Learning Project

Welcome to my beginner-level Assembly Language Learning Repository! This project is designed to help newcomers understand the basics of assembly programming using NASM (Netwide Assembler) on a Linux x86_64 environment. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository provides a simple and practical introduction to assembly language concepts.

## About the Project

This repository contains a basic assembly program that demonstrates fundamental concepts such as:
- **Array manipulation**: Creating and iterating through an array.
- **Prime number identification**: Checking if a number is prime.
- **Squaring numbers**: Calculating the square of each number in the array.
- **Fibonacci sequence**: Generating Fibonacci numbers for each element in the array.

The program is written in NASM assembly and is intended to run on a Linux x86_64 system. It serves as a starting point for understanding low-level programming and how assembly interacts with the CPU and memory.

## Features
- **Simple and beginner-friendly**: The code is well-commented and easy to follow.
- **Hands-on learning**: Practical examples to help you understand core assembly concepts.
- **Debugging tips**: Includes suggestions for debugging and troubleshooting common issues like segmentation faults.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **NASM**: Netwide Assembler (NASM) installed on your system.
- **Linux x86_64**: A 64-bit Linux environment to run the program.
- **Basic knowledge of programming**: Familiarity with basic programming concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals) is helpful but not required.

### Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/assembly-learning.git
   cd assembly-learning
   ```
2. Assemble the program using NASM:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 program.asm -o program.o
   ```
3. Link the object file to create an executable:
   ```bash
   ld program.o -o program
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```

### Code Overview
- **`program.asm`**: The main assembly file containing the code.
- **`.data` section**: Defines the initial array and reserves memory for results.
- **`.text` section**: Contains the program logic, including prime checking, squaring, and Fibonacci calculations.

### Debugging Tips
If you encounter a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), try the following:
- Use a debugger like `gdb` to step through the program.
- Add debug prints to trace the flow of execution.
- Double-check memory accesses and ensure registers are properly initialized.
